            30. How does SpeakerOre handle, If a selected speaker does not show
            up to speak at the event?{" "}
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We do not take any responsibility of the speaker or the event
            manager in any way. It is mutual decision between the two members.
            It is highly unlikely that a speaker does not turn up for the event
            without a valid reason. The subscribers at speakerore.com are
            professionals and serious about their speaking. However if a
            situation arises, we request the event managers to notify us and we
            shall apply our due diligence in the matter. In worst case scenario,
            the speaker will be blacklisted from our portal.
